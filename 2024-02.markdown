# Resolution 2024-02

WHEREAS many caucuses have been requesting extended times for the caucuses in multiple prior years, and the conference coordinators have been unable to build this extended caucus time into the conference schedule; and

WHEREAS Black, Indigenous, people of color, and trans, non-binary, gender-nonconforming, and intersex Pride organizers have not felt fully included in InterPride or the global Pride movement; and

WHEREAS organizers of trans and BIPOC Pride events from different regions have felt particularly excluded from InterPride;

THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT future conferences should include one (1) pre-conference day prior to any other conference programming to be set aside for BIPOC and trans programming created by the BIPOC and trans/non-binary/gender non-conforming/intersex caucuses, working with local BIPOC and/or trans organization as implementing partners; and 

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT InterPride will coordinate the venue(s) needed for the pre-conference programming day; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT InterPride will allocate a portion of scholarship funding for BIPOC and trans organizations from different regions to join pre-conference programming; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT InterPride will allocate time in the first plenary of the annual general meeting for a report-out and/or action items that arise from the pre-conference programming; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that InterPride will meaningfully integrate programming by and for BIPOC and trans communities throughout the regular conference workshops, plenaries, and social events; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT this resolution shall not affect the current standing rules related to the provision of caucuses during the conference.

## Implementation

This resolution, once approved, will require the conference committee and local Pride organizers to secure a venue for pre-conference programming as part of their conference planning process. This resolution will require the BIPOC and Trans Caucuses to work together to develop and execute pre-conference programming.
