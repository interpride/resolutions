# Resolution 2024-03

Put forward by San Diego Pride, endorsed by Tokyo Rainbow Pride, Pride Toronto, Bangkok Pride, and NYC Pride.

WHEREAS: InterPride committees and Board members are not a true reflection of the diversity of the global Pride movement; and

WHEREAS the trans, non-binary, intersex, BIPOC, and disabled communities continue to be marginalized and underrepresented within InterPride;

THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the Board of Directors implement an annual (or more frequent) mandatory demographic and skills survey to be developed through a collaboration between the BIPOC and Trans caucuses and collect responses from all Board and committee co-chair leadership; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT the Board of Directors will utilize an external third-party individual to create a report on the results of the survey within two (2) weeks of receiving responses to this survey; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT the Board of Directors will release this data to the membership through regular member communication within one (1) month of receiving survey responses.

## Implementation 

This resolution, once approved, will require volunteers from BIPOC and Trans caucuses to create a survey to be distributed to all Board members and committee co-chairs. The Board will be responsible for the distribution of the survey and collection of responses, as well as contracting with a volunteer or paid individual to analyze and compile the survey responses into a report. The Board will also be responsible for distributing this information to the membership, and for repeating this process at least once per year.
